Arduino LCD Vumeter

Please note: May 22 2019 -> Version for 4x20 LCD!

Following what I've seen on youtube:

This is a trial to reuse code from google drive located here:

I want to change some things:
- use an I2C LCD instead of usual LCD to save cables, time and useless complications
- no temperature nor time required

... Ok after one sunday and one monday night, it is working like I want.

There is a lot of evolutions I am thinking, but for the moment I am more than happy.
